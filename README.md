# Introduction to Git

This is a presentation I made for [MiNET](https://www.minet.net) and [Kerber'INT](http://wwwassos.minet.net/~kerberint/) students in November 2016.
It introduced Git to beginners but the slides can serve as a memo for more "advanced" users (especially since many concepts were verbally explained).

I forgot to include sources for images, they come from the references listed at the end of the presentation. Sorry for that.
